Genetic Algorithm

The data goes through Selection, Crossover, Mutation and Placement in Genetic Algorithm.
I ran my data on genetic algorithm with the following parameters in the program.
 

I got the accuracy on training data as % and on test data as %.
 

I tried changing the variables maxGeneration, mutateRate, mutateChange and tau but there was no increase in the accuracy. I kept the maxGeneration this high because it represents the number of timed crossover is happening and I believe it would have helped in better accuracy. Anyways I tries with a lower value as well but there was no affect in the accuracy. The program ran for 10minutes for reading all the features of all the data.
After running Winnow, Logistic and Genetic I have realized that itâ€™s not necessary that all the algorithms will be best suitable for all types of data. For implementing a successful machine learning algorithm, we need to know the data and then apply the suitable algorithm to it.
The code and output screenshots can be found in the appropriate folders in the assignment submission.
